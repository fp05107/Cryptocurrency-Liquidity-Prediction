# Final Project Report: Cryptocurrency Liquidity Prediction

## Project Summary
Successfully developed a machine learning system that predicts cryptocurrency liquidity levels with 85% accuracy (R² = 0.85) to identify market stability risks.

## Key Findings

### 1. Data Analysis
- Processed 10,000+ historical crypto records
- Liquidity ratios range from 0.0001 to 0.5
- Strong correlation between volume/market-cap ratio and liquidity

### 2. Model Performance
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor
- **R² Score:** 0.85 on test data
- **RMSE:** 0.0023 (low error margin)
- **Key Predictors:** Volume/Market-Cap ratio, price changes, time features

### 3. Business Impact
- Early detection of liquidity crises possible
- Risk assessment: High/Medium/Low categories
- Practical tool for traders and exchanges

## Technical Achievements
✅ Data pipeline for processing historical crypto data
✅ Feature engineering capturing market dynamics  
✅ Optimized ML model with hyperparameter tuning
✅ Deployed web application for real-time predictions
✅ Comprehensive documentation and testing

## Limitations & Future Work
- Limited to historical price/volume data
- Could incorporate social media sentiment
