# Low-Level Design: Component Implementation

## 1. Data Processing Component
```python
class DataProcessor:
    - clean_data(): Handle missing values, remove duplicates
    - create_features(): Calculate liquidity ratio, volume ratios
    - validate_data(): Check for data quality issues
    2. Feature Engineering
Input Features:

price, 24h_volume, mkt_cap, 24h_change, 7d_change

volume_market_ratio = 24h_volume / mkt_cap

time_features: day_of_week, month

Target Variable:

liquidity_ratio = 24h_volume / mkt_cap

3. Machine Learning Model
Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
Parameters: n_estimators=200, max_depth=15, min_samples_split=5
Training: 80% historical data, time-series split
Evaluation: RMSE, R² score, error analysis

class LiquidityPredictor:
    - load_model(): Load trained Random Forest
    - preprocess_input(): Transform user input to features
    - predict(): Generate liquidity prediction
    - assess_risk(): Convert ratio to risk level
